# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## pnpm Version Issue Fix

I've updated the configuration to fix the pnpm version error you encountered.

## Option 1: Updated pnpm Configuration (Recommended)
I've updated:
- `package.json`: Changed to `pnpm@9.0.0` (more stable version)
- `railway.json`: Added explicit pnpm installation

**Try redeploying with these changes.**

## Option 2: Use npm Instead (Fallback)
If pnpm still causes issues, Railway works great with npm:

1. **Rename files**:
   - `railway.json` â†’ `railway-pnpm.json` (backup)
   - `railway-npm.json` â†’ `railway.json`

2. **Redeploy** - Railway will use npm instead

## Option 3: Manual Railway Configuration
If the JSON config doesn't work, set these manually in Railway dashboard:

**Build Command**: 
```bash
npm install -g pnpm@9.0.0 && pnpm install && pnpm build
```

**Start Command**:
```bash
cd apps/web && pnpm start
```

## Option 4: Simplest Approach
For the most reliable deployment:

**Build Command**: 
```bash
npm install && npm run build
```

**Start Command**:
```bash
cd apps/web && npm start
```

## Expected Result
After fixing the pnpm issue, your Railway deployment should:
- âœ… Build successfully
- âœ… Connect to database without issues
- âœ… Fix the 401 authentication errors
- âœ… Work much better than Vercel for your use case

## Next Steps
1. **Commit and push** the updated files
2. **Redeploy** on Railway
3. **Add environment variables** from `railway-env.txt`
4. **Test wallet authentication** - should work perfectly!

Railway is much more reliable for database-heavy apps like yours! ðŸš‚
